# GA-based-Path-Generation
 
The project demonstrates the use of a Genetic Algorithm to find the optimal path between target points, with potential applications in various domains. It provides flexibility in choosing distance metrics, population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate to explore different solution possibilities. The code's efficiency and effectiveness were showcased through fitness plots and visualizations of optimal paths.
